These are a collection of simple use cases of hitting the [StackExchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/) using Javascript, C#, and Python. Python example courtesy of (Shawn Frame)[https://github.com/sframe].

The C# and Javascript example should be fairly straightfroward to run. To get the python example running please refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/sframe/python-stackexchange-api).
